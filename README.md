## Call Trace \(Prank\)


</div>

### Description

I wrote this after seeing the Matrix. It doesn't look as stylish as the Matrix one, but you can impress your friends with being able to trace anyone on the phone line! Notes:If there are any bugs, please post them. PLEASE COMMENT AND VOTE! Also: If you modify the program and improve it at all, please email me your revised source code! wackygenius@wackygenius.com
 
### More Info
 
On the first form just type in the required info of anyone on the phone. If you click the connected to the internet checkbox then it will open MapQuest.com and pinpoint the location.

1 assumption: THIS IS ONLY A JOKE!
